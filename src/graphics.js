// Graphics quality: what each level renders, how a device's starting level is
// guessed, and the adaptive controller that keeps the frame rate near the
// display's refresh rate.
//
// A level changes the drawing buffer's density, the sun shadow's detail, and
// how much of the route stays built around the car. AO is a separate, opt-in
// setting that neither presets nor Auto switch on or off. While it is on it
// costs what the level can afford: it is drawn from the same drawing buffer, so
// it shrinks with `density`, and `aoQuality` bounds it on dense screens.
// Lighting and scenery are identical at
// every level, so a route looks like itself on every device. Nothing here
// changes the shader light counts, which would make the browser recompile every
// program mid-drive.

// `density` is a fraction of the device's own pixel ratio, not a ceiling on it.
// A ceiling did nothing on the displays that need the help most: clamping to 3,
// 2 and 1.5 all leave a 1x laptop panel rendering at exactly 1x, so three of
// the four levels were the same picture at the same price. A fraction removes
// pixels on every display.
//
// `chunks` is how much of the route stays built. The far chunk in each
// direction is off-screen at every camera height — hiding them was measured
// pixel-for-pixel identical on all four routes in the widest view, worth eight
// to eleven per cent of the frame's draw calls — so the cheaper levels drop
// them, and High keeps them as headroom for reversing.
